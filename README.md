DigitPanic:

A Hurry Up Number Game with a Pop
---------------------------------




A simple game created in Sprite Kit by a group of 3 developers where you tap on the sequential falling numbers as the weight of gravity plays against you. 
â€‹
I personally worked on the UX design of the app, the particle effects and the physics for the game.
